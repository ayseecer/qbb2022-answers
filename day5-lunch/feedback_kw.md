# Feedback day5-lunch

## Exercise 1

Very cool idea to use Python to make a comma-delimited file tab-delimited instead. I also like the commentary describing what your commands should be doing.

Some of the commands seem incomplete or missing. Like what file are you using as input with `sort -k 1`? Did you use `join` ever? Please fill this record of commands out more if possible.

## Exercise 2

### 1 -- data input

good job reading in the data

### 2 -- scatter plots

Good plots and labels overall! I would recommend switching your axes since you will be using this data for a linear regression and the independent variable is commonly on the x-axis and the dependent variable on the y-axis.

I don't see the code for the scatter plots in the `README.md` or in the `day5-lunch2.py` script. Please include if possible.

### 3 & 4 -- OLS

You are correct on the size of the relationships. Please clarify or restate what those sizes mean with regards to the variables and how they are related (optional).

Good job reporting the p-values

### 5 -- histogram

Good histogram

### 6 -- ttest

Good use of the ttest.

### 7 -- predict

Good job predicting, and nice use of the predict function!
