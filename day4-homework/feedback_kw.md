# Feedback day4 homework

The heatmaps overall are very good, but the tick labels should be changed to reflect the actual probability of heads and number of tosses (you can use the `xticklabels` and `yticklabels` arguments/options in the `sns.heatmap()` function like you do, but instead of setting them to "auto", try setting them equal to the `n_toss` and `prob_heads` arrays)

While you have submitted both heatmaps, I only see code creating one of the heatmaps. 

I didn't see a README with comments/observations for part A (describing the numpy array), part C (describing the results/heatmap trends), or part D (comparing to the real life study)
