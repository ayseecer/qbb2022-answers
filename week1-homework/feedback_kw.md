# Week 1 Genome Assembly -- Feedback

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1  = 10 points out of 10 possible points

1. Question 1.1, 1.4 how many reads (0.5 pts each)

  * great --> +1

2. Question 1.2, 1.4 simulation script(s)

  * good work! --> +1

3. Question 1.2, 1.4 plotting script(s)

  * nice job --> +1

4. Question 1.2, 1.4 histograms with overlaid Poisson distributions (0.5 pts each)

  * very nice graphs overall with fantastic labels! if you would like a height matchup with the poisson distribution and the histogram, you could change the number of bins used in the histogram to match the number of unique coverage whole number values plotted/represented in the dataset --> +1

5. Question 1.3, 1.4 how much of genome not sequenced/comparison to Poisson expectations (0.5 pts each, 0.25 for answer and 0.25 for code)

  * Good observations from the graphs -- since we were looking for actual numbers like counting how many zeros were in your `list` and checking the first element of `y` --> +1

6. Question 2 De novo assembly (0.5 pts each, 0.25 for answer and 0.25 for code)

  * number of contigs --> +0.5; Good!
  * total length of contigs --> +0.5, total length is if you add column 2 together

7. Question 2 De novo assembly cont (0.5 pts each, 0.25 for answer and 0.25 for code)

  * size of largest contig --> +0.5
  * contig n50 size --> +0.5; Great!

8. whole genome alignment (0.33 pts each, 0.33/2 for answer and 0.33/2 for code)

  * average identity --> +0.33
  * length of longest alignment --> + 0.33
  * how many insertions and deletions in assembly --> **regrade**, +0.33

9. decoding the insertion (0.5 pts each, 0.25 for answer and 0.25 for code)

  * position of insertion in assembly --> + 0.5, very good
  * length of novel insertion -->You want to add one to that length. Length is end - start + 1, or that 710 bases you said; --> +0.5

10. decoding the insertion cont (0.5 pts each, 0.25 for answer and 0.25 for code)

  * DNA sequence of encoded message --> + 0.5
  * secret message --> + 0.5


Fantastic work!!
