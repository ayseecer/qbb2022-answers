Really really awesome start! Your plots all look excellent, and your plink commands are correct. One very minor thing: in your manhattan plots, I think you may be also plotting the pvals for the covariates. If you look in the output of running the linear regression, there's a `TEST` column that should help you out with that. (no points deducted).

We still need your boxplot and answer to question 7 (-2.5 points)

Really great work so far though!
