Question 1: Made README.md file in week4-homework directory.

Question 2: cd into gwas_data and run `plink --vcf genotypes.vcf --pca 10` to make plink.eigenval, plink.eigenvec, plink.log, and plink.nosex. The figure is in github and is saved as week4_plot1.png. The python script is in github and is saved as week4.py.

Question 3: Ran `plink --vcf genotypes.vcf --freq` to get a plink.frq file. The python script I used is in github named week4_2.py and the histogram image is in github called week4.py.
