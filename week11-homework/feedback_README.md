Great work, Ayse! This is really close to being complete. We just need a couple of things:
1. It looks like you've gotten started on generating the final labelled plot (I see some commented out that's renaming 3 clusters), but we need the rest of the code that renames all 6 relevant clusters, and then plots a tSNE or UMAP with the clusters labeled by their cell type (-1.5 points)

That said, I believe Kate said we could give you full credit on this assignment because of the issues you were running into

Everything else looks great!
