Question 2c: This would be a good way of finding the median length exon, but we were curious how you would find the median number of exons per gene
Question 3: This is the annotation that has the most regions, but this isn't necessarily the largest fraction of the genome because all of those annotations could be really small. You'd want to calculate the total length of regions for each of the annotations and compare.

Nice work!
