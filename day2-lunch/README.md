Exercise 2: Median number of exons was outputted to be 4.

import bed_parser

#print(bed_file[0])

number_of_exons = [] #creates an empty list 

for i in bed_file:
    number_of_exons.append(i[9]) #appends the empty list by adding the nineth (indexed) column integers and storing it as a list.

number_of_exons.sort() #sorts the number_of_exons list of exon numbers in ascending order.

print(number_of_exons[len(number_of_exons)//2])
