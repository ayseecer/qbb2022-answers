Great start, Ayse! Just a few more things we need before this is complete:

1. Missing answer to Question 2 (-0.5 point)
2. Missing answers and any code you used for Question 3 (-3 points)
3. You've got a start for Question 4, but we want to look at the taxonomy of ALL contiigs within each bin, not just the first contig. How might we do this with code? Also, we want to look at the breakdown at specific levels of the taxonomy, so we want to grab specific parts of the taxonomy string. How could we do that? We need answers for both 4A and 4B.
